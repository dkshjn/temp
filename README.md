1. I’ve completed all mandatory LMS trainings. The goal now is to ensure I stay updated with any intern or team-specific sessions, so I’m fully aligned with Citi’s policies around compliance, security, and data handling. I aim to wrap up all required onboarding and training modules by Week 4.

2. I’m working on a tool to analyze and classify Maven dependencies across all Citi repositories with the goal of improving how dependencies are managed at scale. With thousands of repos in play, each having more than 100 libraries, this helps avoid redundant or unnecessary imports, makes dependency usage easier to track, and supports cleaner, more consistent reuse across teams.
The core version of the tool is already functional, with dependency extraction, rule-based classification, and database integration in place. The next step is to enhance this by integrating a GenAI-based approach for more flexible and scalable classification

3. To contribute more meaningfully to the tech stack, I’m dedicating 1–2 hours per week to learning core backend concepts, particularly Java and Spring Boot. The plan is to complete at least one structured course by Week 7, and apply the concepts wherever relevant in my project work.
This will also help me better understand the kinds of frameworks and architectures used across Citi's services, especially since many of the dependencies I’m classifying are backend-related.

4. To make the most of this internship, I plan to actively seek feedback from my manager and mentor at both the mid-point and end of the internship. I’ll use this input to reflect on what’s working well and where I can improve, and will maintain a short personal log to track goals, takeaways and growth areas.
So far, the feedback has been positive and the progress is on track. I want to make sure it stays that way.

5. In parallel with day-to-day work, I’ve started preparing for the final presentation we’ll be delivering at the end of the internship. The goal is to clearly explain the project I’ve worked on, why it matters, and how it contributes to Citi. I’ve begun gathering content and noting down my thoughts early so I can refine the message over time.
