Good morning Sir,

I had a query regarding the demat and trading account disclosure on Cody. While filling out the form, there was a question about having an account with a non-preferred broker. It mentioned that we either need to close the account within 60 days, transfer it to a preferred broker, or seek an exception.

Since Iâ€™m an intern and the purpose was only to disclose the account, I mentioned this in the comments section. I just wanted to confirm if this approach is acceptable.

Thank you!
