1. Complete Mandatory and Citi-Specific Trainings
I’ve already completed all required LMS trainings. The goal now is to stay on top of any upcoming intern-specific or team-specific trainings, making sure I’m fully aligned with Citi’s compliance, security, and data handling standards by the end of Week 3.

2. Deliver the Dependency Analysis Tool
I’m working on building a tool to extract and classify Maven library dependencies across ASPEN repositories. The goal is to complete a working end-to-end version (including database integration and classification logic) by Week 6, with regular demos and check-ins to track progress.

3. Build a Knowledge Base of Categorized Libraries
Alongside the tool, I plan to create a structured, searchable knowledge base of categorized libraries used across the platform. This should support future audits, simplify reuse, and help teams quickly understand what libraries are in use and where.

4. Invest in Self-Learning (Java + Backend Concepts)
To contribute more meaningfully to the tech stack, I’m dedicating 1-2 hours per week to learning core backend concepts, especially Java and Spring Boot. The plan is to complete at least one structured course by Week 7, and apply the concepts wherever relevant in my work.

5. Reflect and Gather Feedback
To make the most of the internship, I plan to request structured feedback from my manager and mentor at the mid-point and end of the internship. I’ll also be doing a personal reflection to track how I’ve grown and areas I can still improve.
